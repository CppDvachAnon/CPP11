Training CPP11 Code style and skill

## How to contribute
* Each project is located in its own folder and branch
* Checkout a branch that you want to contribute to
* Make changes
* Submit a new pull request

## Rules
* The purpose of this is to make simple programs as much as possible complex with various C++ features.
* As higher your code complexity is better, but it doesn't mean you are allowed to shitcode, shitcode is unacceptable.
* Only C++11 and higher is allowed ( but the highest version must be supported by the latest gcc ).
* Your code must be as much as possible in modern C++ style with, as many as you can, lambdas, autos, shared_pointers, decltypes, abstractions, templates and shit. More abstractions and generics.
* Don't even try to write clean and simple code. It won't be accepted.
* Your code should work properly.
* Only english comments, variable/class/function names in code are allowed.
* Your code should be able to be compiled with the latest GCC versons and must not use any external libraries.
* Build system is CMake.

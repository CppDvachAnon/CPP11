## Rules
* Only C++11 and higher is allowed ( but the highest version must be supported by the latest gcc ).
* You code must be as much as possible in modern C++ style with, as many as you can, lambdas, autos, shared_pointers, decltypes, abstractions, templates and shit. 
* More abstractions and generic code.
* Don't even try to write clean and simple code. It won't be accepted.
* As higher your code complexity is better, but it doesn't mean that you should shitcode, shitcode is also unacceptable.
* The purpose is to make simple programs as much as possible complex with various C++ features.
* Your code should work properly.
* Only english comments, variable/class/function names in code are allowed.
* Your code should be able to be compiled with the latest GCC versons and must not use any external libraries.
* Build system is CMake.
